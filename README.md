# Greetings Slackers
This simple script written in basic Python will allow you to hook into the real time API of Slack and perform a greeting to every new joiner!
Usually this is used to tell new joiners about the network, the guidelines, rules, useful links etc etc

## About this Fork

This fork was created for the following reasons:

  * Use a hardcoded [`WELCOME_MESSAGE.txt`](WELCOME_MESSAGE.txt) in code, as opposed to an
    environment variable.
  * Add the python `logging` module.
  * Bump the `websocket-client` package version to avoid a bug.
  * Add the ability to debug via a special channel that sends
    welcome message when joined.

**Notes:**

  * This branch, `develop/archivers`, **auto-deploys to Heroku**. We
    recommend submitting changes to this branch via pull request.
  * We use a [**bot user**](https://api.slack.com/bot-users), in fact, [this
    little guy](https://archivers.slack.com/services/238329276295)
    (sign-in required).
